Version: 1.3.1
Title: Network of Differential Equations
Description: Simulates a network of ordinary differential equations of order
    two. The package provides an easy interface to construct networks. In addition
    you are able to define different external triggers to manipulate the trajectory.
    The method is described by Surmann, Ligges, and Weihs (2014) <doi:10.1109/ENERGYCON.2014.6850482>.
